## :video_game: Gameplay

Ball is generated randomly on the field, and the time on the semaphore begins.
A player has 90 seconds to score as many points as he can.
Angle and strength shot can be altered using keyboard.
As soon as the ball hits the floor a new one is generated. Score is printed on the scoreboard.
Ball that is generated can be regular basketball or a bowling ball. Naturally the bowling ball is heavier and hence needs a greater shot power to score.
Changing the angle and strength of the shot can be seen as small balls that represent in what direction is the ball heading.
If hard mode is activated this shot assistance is not visible.
Player can see the field from all angles and change the lighting.
